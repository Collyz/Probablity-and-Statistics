 - Project 1
    - Purpose:
    - To implement basic statistics principles such as mean, median, mode etc, into programming. 
      To learn how to create and write to a file as well as create a Monte Carlo simulation for the 
      Monty Hall problem.
                           
 - Project 2
    - Purpose:
    - To create multiple distribution calculating programs that give the distribution result as well as 
      their expected and variance values. Distributions include, binomial, geometric, hypergeometric, poisson.
      More file manipulation was learned to create points for the graph of x^2. This data was then salted and then smoothed.
      
 - Project 3
    - Purpose:
    - Learn how to use existing jar libraries to create graphs of the previous projects salted data. The libraries used are
      Apache Commons Mathematics and JFreeChart. 
    - An online database will be used to test every distribution from the previous
      project.
    - Use of Octave to graph salted data and then smooth the data. Teaches how to use foreign api and impliment it
