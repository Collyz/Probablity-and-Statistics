#### Project 1
- Purpose:
    - To implement basic statistics principles such as mean, median, mode etc, into programming. 
    - To learn how to create and write to a file as well as create a Monte Carlo simulation for the Monty Hall problem. 
        - The problem consists of a game show where a player must select one of three doors. Two doors have a goat behind them while one of the doors has a prize. The player then makes a decisions, after which the player is told that one of the two remaining doors has a goat behind it and they are able to change their answer if they want to. The simulation calculates two probabilities, the player winning if they stick with their choice, and the other is if they do not change their choice.
                           
#### Project 2
- Purpose:
    - To create multiple distribution calculating programs that give the distribution result as well as their expected and variance values. Distributions include, binomial, geometric, hypergeometric, poisson. More file manipulation was learned to create points for the graph of x<sup>2</sup>. This data was then salted and then smoothed.
    - A poker hand simulation was created for 7 out of 10 possible winning hands in poker. The simulation accurately predicts the probability of winning these hands for 10000 hands. The number of hands tested can be increased to produce an even more precise numerical probability.
#### Project 3
- Purpose:
    - Learn how to use existing jar libraries to create graphs of the previous projects salted data. The libraries used are Apache Commons Mathematics and JFreeChart. 
    - An online database will be used to test every distribution from the previous project.
    - Use of Octave to graph salted data and then smooth the data. Teaches how to use foreign api and impliment it
